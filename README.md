# Cypress test suite

I'm use Cypress e2e test framework for integration tests

https://www.cypress.io/

### Installation

You should have node.js to run tests:

```shr
brew install node
```

Make sure that you have already run:

```shr
$ npm init
```

Install Cypress:

```shr
$ npm install cypress --save-dev
```

Open Cypress:
```shr
npx cypress open
```
